## TODO List:

1. Rename methods in MongoDatabase to callUserStoryX etc
2. Finish off mongo queries that use SQL
3. Make sure graphs are correct, right axes and data etc
4. Get logging sorted
5. Get documentation sorted - see below
6. Useful doc strings on every method/class/erd
7. Useful comments where needed
8. Put class diagram on github
9. Once SQL user logins added, have one login system in the TUI


**Documentation Information**
Tried to get the documentation working using Sphinx. Managed to get a HTML file but couldn't get any data from the Python files.
